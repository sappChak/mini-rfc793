### Send Sequence Space:

                   1         2          3          4
              ----------|----------|----------|----------
                     SND.UNA    SND.NXT    SND.UNA
                                          +SND.WND

        1 - old sequence numbers which have been acknowledged
        2 - sequence numbers of unacknowledged data
        3 - sequence numbers allowed for new data transmission
        4 - future sequence numbers which are not yet allowed

                                    +RCV.WND

        1 - old sequence numbers which have been acknowledged
        2 - sequence numbers allowed for new reception
        3 - future sequence numbers which are not yet allowed
